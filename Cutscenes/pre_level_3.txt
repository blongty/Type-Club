Narrator;Life goes on, an empty shell of what it was.
Narrator;Seven years later Kaiju dies too, and you wish you could follow him.
Narrator;You retire at age 67 and buy a house on the beach.
Narrator;One day, you see someone that looks just like Caroline walking along the beach. 
Narrator;You run up to her and tap her on the back.
Narrator;She turns around. It's her.
Prompt;You're alive!
Narrator;She looks at you with a confused face. 
Woman;Well I'd sure hope I am. Who are you?
Narrator;You tell her everything and she still doesn't remember.
Woman;No my name is Carrie, I don't know anyone named Caroline.
Narrator;"She has amnesia," you tell yourself.
Tom;Well how would you like to go with me to the new pizza place that opened up downtown?
Narrator;She smiles.
Carrie;Sure.
Narrator;You go to the pizza place together.
Narrator;You feel like it has to be her, she's acting like she always used to, with her stupid jokes and funny stories.
Narrator;You laugh.
Tom;It's like I get to meet you and fall in love with you all over again.
Carrie;What was that? I didn't hear you.
Tom;Oh, nothing.
Prompt;It has to be her
Carrie;Uh huh okay buddy. How about we do this again next week?
Tom;Oh, yea sure thing!
Narrator;After 2 years, you get married and end up spending most of your time sitting on the beach together.
Prompt;Life is good
Narrator;After 3 happy years you go to the doctor for a routine check-up. The doctor sighs.
Doctor;Tom, there's no other way to say this, you're dying.
Prompt;Oh.
Narrator;You go home.
Carrie;How was the doctor's visit, is everything okay?
Tom;Y-yea, he said I'm as healthy as ever.
Prompt;I'll tell her eventually
Narrator;You just tell her you're going to the library whenever you go to therapy.
Narrator;One day when you go you just imagine what it would be like to fight it. 
Narrator;If only you could just punch and kick the hell out of it.
