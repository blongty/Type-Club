top;Tommy: Prepare to die, homework!
bot;Homework: Hey kid, I'm just trying to help you learn.
top;Tommy: Well you're doing a bad job!
top;Tommy: You just make me angry and stop me from watching Kawaii Kaiju!
bot;Homework: I feel like school is a little more important than T.V. kid.
top;Tommy; It isn't!
bot;Homework: Well, if you get distracted enough, you might get in big trouble.
top;Tommy: I won't get in trouble, I'll be able to at least defeat you once!
bot;Homework: Only once?
top;Tommy: S-...Shut it!
;;;
top;Tommy: Haha, take THAT! 
bot;Homework: OW! Kid, what the hell are you doing? That hurt!
top;Tommy: So what you're saying is I'm WINNING?
bot;Homework: No! This isn't going to teach you anything, stop it!
top;Tommy: Never! I want to play, not do homework!
bot;Homework: You have to focus, Tommy!
;;;
top;Tommy: Hah. I am so good at school, are you even trying?
bot;Homework: Alright that's enough.
bot;Homework: GRAAARGH!!!!
top;Tommy: Uh oh.
bot;Homework: HAH, can you resist these DISTRACTIONS?!
bot;Homework: If you can't solve defeat THESE problems, you'll lose everything!
;;;
bot;Homework: *Blech* Damn you Tommy!
top;Tommy: Haha yes, I am the KING of homework!

;;;;
top;Tommy: Ugh! I don't know what 2+2 is!
bot;Homework: HAHAHAHA!!! You lose!
bot;Homework: Maybe next time buddy
bot;Homework: ...if you can get past my first two stages and my final form, that is.
