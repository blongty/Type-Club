bot;Computer: Hey man. I know I know, I feel you. Don't worry I'm here for you.
top;Tom: SHUT UP!

bot;Computer: OW! Dude what the hell, I'm your computer! What did I do to deserve this!?
top;Tom: You're the reason why I'm still here and not at home!
bot;Computer: Why do you even wanna go home so bad. Is something wrong?
